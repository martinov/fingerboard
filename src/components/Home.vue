      <h4>Simulator 3D Training Guide</h4>
      <h5>Principals</h5>
      <p>
        Fingerboards are most effective at training contact strength and general upper body strength.
        Contact strength, also referred to as finger strength, is simply the ability to hold onto the holds
        (as opposed to the ability to move between the holds). It is the single most important type of
        strength for a climber to have. If you can't even hold onto the grips, there is no way you will be
        able to move between them.
      </p>
      <h5>Fundamentals</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Grasp the Grips</strong>: You want to use an open-handed grip as often as possible.
        Most climbers are weaker open-handed than crimped, so you may find this difficult at first, but you'll
        get used to it. Training open-handed will increase your crimp strength (but not vice-versa),
        and it is essential for holding pockets, slopers, and certain edges, as well as making moves at maximum
        stretch and catching dynos. Most importantly, however, using an open hand lowers the potential for injury.
        As you adapt to training, you can incorporate a little crimp training to increase your maximum edge-holding
        power, but keep it to a minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Warm Up, Warm Down</strong>: It is critical to warm up thoroughly. You can start by climbing,
        bouldering, or doing easy pull-ups and dead hangs, along with gentle stretching. Make the first 15 minutes
        ridiculously easy and gradually increase the intensity until you're at full power. Reverse this process
        at the end of your session to prevent injury and speed up recovery. The warm down should be even easier
        than the warm up. It should feel as if you're doing almost nothing. The idea is just to keep the blood
        flowing for 15 or 20 minutes after the high intensity part of your workout.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Recovery</strong>: To maximize your gains and prevent injury, you should always be fully recovered
        before a training session. Not resting enough between workouts will soon lead to a plateau, quickly
        followed by injury and burnout. If it takes you longer than normal to feel warmed up, or if you haven't
        noticed any improvement in 3 or 4 sessions, you probably need more rest. Listen to your body and be
        flexible with your training schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Making It Easier</strong>: If you find certain exercises or holds too difficult at first,
        you can put one foot on a chair or have a training partner assist you to take off as much weight as necessary.
        Be sure to have a clean, open, well-padded landing area, as an awkward, off-balance fall is a greater
        possibility when your feet are helping to take your weight.
